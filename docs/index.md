### Rachel Kyu Yeon Lee

Hello! I'm a fourth year undergraduate at the University of Chicago, majoring in mathematics and comparative literature. This summer I participated in [the University of Chicago's Mathematics REU](http://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2021/). My research topic focused on finding division points of algebraic curves, touching on concepts in Galois theory, elliptic curves and functions, and modular forms; a final draft is forthcoming.

My undergraduate comparative literature thesis aims to understand autofiction through the lens of psychoanalytic theory, semiotics and speech acts, and affect theory. I'm currently reading Jacques Lacan, J.L. Austin, Judith Butler, and Chris Kraus. My writing on racial melancholia and white masculinity has been published in [Rutgers University's Proteus Journal](https://sites.rutgers.edu/proteusjournal/). Prior to starting at UChicago, I worked as a freelance journalist and mathematics tutor.

In my free time, I enjoy reading great fiction, learning cool algebra facts, knitting, and eating rainbow cookies.

Links to my mathematical writing (mostly notes and slides from an REU talk) are [here](https://rkl99.github.io/rkl99/notes).
